## How the System Works (Manual Fulfillment)
To keep costs low (₹49) and avoid heavy platform fees, this project uses a high-trust manual fulfillment flow:

1. **Scan to Pay:** Users scan the UPI QR code on the landing page.
2. **Verification:** Users click the "Send Details" button which triggers a WhatsApp message containing their **Email ID** and **Payment Screenshot**.
3. **Delivery:** Once payment is verified manually, the private access link (`/copy` restricted) is sent directly to the user's WhatsApp.
